      <h1>Hello! &#128075;</h1>

      <p>My name is Viacheslav, at the moment I live in Batumi &#127468;&#127466;.</p>
      <p>
        I&#39;m a Frontend Developer with 3 years of experience. 
      </p>
      <p>Building apps with Vue.js since 2021.

      <h2>Sidus Games (from 2022)</h2>
      <p>
        Currently I working on frontend part of futuristic NFT gaming universe.
      </p>

      <h2>ExtTeam (2021-2022)</h2>
      <p>
        Here I created an intranet portal and landing page builder for a customer.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the intranet, I worked with the admin panel and the user&#39;s personal page, 
        which includes a business calendar, a to-do list, and a bulletin board.
      </p>
      <p>
        I spent much more time on the landing page builder. It didn&#39;t have many options, 
        but it was simple and allowed you to create a lot of different pages.
      </p>
      <h2>AdCombo (2020-2021)</h2>
      <p>
        I have created marketing landing pages, sometimes with modern animations and 
        interactive forms, sometimes quite simple. 
      </p>
      <p>
      This was my first web development experience and I got more familiar with 
      JavaScript and frameworks, but I didn&#39;t like the new client products so I left.
