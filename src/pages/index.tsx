      <h1>Hello! &#128075;</h1>

      <p>My name is Viacheslav, currently I live in Tbilisi &#127468;&#127466;.</p>
      <p>
        I participated in creating a corporate portal, admin panels and landing pages 
        constructor with Vue.js and Nuxt; also I have two years of experience in page 
        templates development and few month of work with React.
      </p>
      <h2>ExtTeam (2021-2022)</h2>
      <p>
        Here I create an intranet portal and landing page constructor for big trademark; 
        also I helped to fix or complete tasks on diffirent teams projects.
        </p><p>On intranet I worked with admin panel and user&#39;s personal page, that includes 
        business calendar, task list and information board.
        </p><p>Much more time I gived to landing page constructor. We had small team and 
        short time here, so constructor had not big lot of options - but was simple and
        helps to create big number of diffirent pages.
      </p>
      <h2>AdCombo (2020-2021)</h2>
      <p>
        I created marketing landing pages - sometimes with modern animations and 
        interactive forms, sometimes quite simple. Also I update old templates an fix bugs in them. 
        </p><p>This was my first web development experience and I got more familiar with JavaScript and 
        frameworks - but don&#39;t like the client&#39;s products so I left the place.
      </p>
      <h2>GlassFurnitura (2017-2020)</h2>
      <p>
        Here I worked as a web administrator: monitored the state of the company&#39;s 
        stores and content pages, created content, worked with the product database and 
        communicated with freelancers.
        </p><p>I also updated e-commerce templates, created simple 
        landing pages, learned HTML/CSS, and used jQuery to bring the pages to life.
